Firefox is the browser I use. I like it because it isn't a memory hogger (Chrome!), and it's open source. Although it's extensions aren't as good as some of Chrome's, it has a fairly good offering, and is very customisable. I also use <a href="https://brave.com">Brave <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> sometimes.
