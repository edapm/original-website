I discovered Obsidian on <a href="https://www.keepproductive.com/">Keep Productive <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, and it was started by the creators of <a href="https://dynalist.io/">Dynalist <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> as a lockdown project. It's similar to Roam Research, but everything is stored locally, as Markdown (.md) files. It's free for personal use, although it's still in beta. Like Roam, it has a graph view to show all your notes' connections with each other. It's also highly customisable, and you can change colours and the design by adding a custom CSS file.
