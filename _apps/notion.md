Notion is a kind-of all-in-one notetaking app. I first discovered it via <a href="https://aliabdaal.com">Ali Abdaal <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, and it is a great app. You can organise all your pages via "databases", and it has a a drag-and-drop-like interface to reorganise elements. However, I find it can lack flexibility, which is why I started using <a href="#obsidian">Obsidian</a>. It's free, with unlimited pages, although you're limited to a 5MB upload size for attachments.
